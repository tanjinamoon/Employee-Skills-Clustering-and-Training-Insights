# Employee Skills Clustering and Training Insights


## Project Overview
This project analyzes workforce development data from NLS (National Learning Services) to evaluate training participation, employee skill patterns, and engagement outcomes. The goal is to generate data-driven insights that support more targeted and effective employee development strategies.

---

## Problem Statement
NLS offers multiple training programs but faces challenges in understanding:
- How employee skills and engagement vary across groups
- Which employees benefit most from training programs
- How training strategies can be better targeted

This project applies analytics techniques to uncover meaningful employee segments and inform workforce planning decisions.

## Data Sources
Relational datasets including:
- Employee profiles and office assignments
- Training courses and enrollment records
- Skill assessment results
- Employee survey responses
- Local office and regional structure data

Datasets were joined using appropriate keys to ensure correct granularity and accurate aggregation.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and relational joins
- Exploratory data analysis
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-means clustering for employee segmentation
- Interpretation of clusters using skill and engagement metrics

---

## Key Insights
- Employees cluster into distinct groups based on skills and engagement
- Some clusters show strong skills but lower training participation
- Other clusters benefit more from targeted development opportunities
- A single training strategy is unlikely to be effective for all employees

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
